## Description 

This is a programme that dynamically creates a README.md file based on the responses given by the user. From the command line, the user is given prompts to answer; answers that are used within the generated markdown. 

### Technologies Used:
- Javascript
- Node.js
- Inquirer, colors and figlet npm packages
- The command line (CLI)

### What I learnt: 
- How to install and use external npm packages within my own programme
- Using node.js allows us to use JavaScript without the need of a browser 
- Why package.json files are created (helps users install dependencies in npm)
- How to create a command line application that dynamically generates a README file based on the user's input 
- The importance of referring to the docs when stuck
